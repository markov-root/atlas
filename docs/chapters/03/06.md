# Combining Strategies

The exact interplay of strategies is debatable, but this section outlines one plausible sequence of dependencies.

**For Misuse:**

- Access Control is the current baseline, but its long-term robustness is doubtful.

- This necessitates Defense Acceleration to harden society against misuse, perhaps using AI itself.

- In parallel, Socio-technical Approaches like regulation and norms are crucial to deter misuse attempts.

**For AGI Safety:**

- Transparent Thoughts could enable easier monitoring, facilitating near-term AI Control to manage risks from early AGIs.

- Meanwhile, research must continue towards the fundamental goal of Solving Alignment.

**For ASI Safety:**

- Controllable AGI might help Automate Alignment Research.

- Success could lead to inherently Safe-by-Design Systems.

- If time runs short before solutions emerge, World Coordination (e.g., a pause) becomes vital.

- Failing that, Deterrence is a highly risky last resort.

**Transversal Strategies:**

- Effective Organizational Safety is necessary but requires enforcement beyond voluntary commitments (e.g., post-Seoul/Paris Summit lapses).

- This points to the need for binding AI Governance.

- Achieving strong governance likely requires widespread Safety Culture and outreach, unless a major 'warning shot' forces the issue.
