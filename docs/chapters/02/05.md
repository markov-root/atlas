# Systemic Risks

**Systemic risks emerge from interactions between AI systems and society, not from individual AI failures.** Unlike misuse or misalignment risks that focus on specific AI systems behaving badly, systemic risks arise from how multiple AI systems—even when working exactly as designed—interact with each other and with human societal structures like markets, democratic institutions, and social networks. These risks parallel those in other complex domains: the 2008 financial crisis wasn't caused by any single bank's decision but emerged from the collective behavior of many institutions making individually reasonable choices that combined to threaten the entire financial system ([Haldane and May, 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09659)).

<Note title="Properties of complex systems that lead to systemic AI risks" collapsed={true}>

There are various properties of complex systems that we might want to pay attention to when thinking about systemic risks from interaction of AI with other systems. Some of these are:

- **Emergence:** Complex systems exhibit emergent behaviors that can't be predicted by analyzing components in isolation. When we connect many AI systems to each other and to human institutions, the resulting behavior can't be understood by simply examining each AI system individually. The entire financial market, rather than any single trading algorithm, determines asset prices and market stability. Similarly, the collective impact of many AI systems shapes societal outcomes in ways that transcend individual system behaviors. ([Friston et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01354); [Steinhardt, 2022](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/pZaPhGg2hmmPwByHc); [Hendrycks, 2025](https://www.aisafetybook.com/textbook/introduction-to-complex-systems))

- **Feedback loops:** Amplify changes and create self-reinforcing cycles. Small initial effects can grow exponentially when outputs from one process become inputs to another. AI recommendation systems that optimize for engagement might gradually push users toward more extreme content, changing social discourse and political beliefs—which in turn affects what content gets created and what people engage with ([Jiang et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10730)).

- **Non-linearity:** Small changes can produce disproportionately large effects. Complex systems rarely respond proportionally to inputs. Instead, tiny alterations can trigger massive changes once certain thresholds are crossed. This property makes systemic risks particularly hard to predict and control, since minor adjustments to AI systems could cascade into major societal transformations.

- **Self-organization:** Structures without central coordination. Multiple AI systems optimizing for their objectives can spontaneously organize into patterns that no designer intended. We already see this in financial markets, where algorithmic traders develop strategies in response to each other's behaviors, creating market dynamics that no single actor controls ([Friston et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01354))

- **Agent-agnosticism:** Systemic risks arise regardless of agents or alignment. These risks emerge from processes, system structure and dynamics rather than from specific AI intentions. Even perfectly aligned AI systems that operate exactly as designed could collectively produce harmful outcomes when their interactions create unintended consequences. ([Critch, 2021](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/LpM3EAakwYdS6aRKf/what-multipolar-failure-looks-like-and-robust-agent-agnostic))

</Note>

**AI-driven systemic failures can follow two distinct causal pathways.** The literature describes these as "going out with a bang" and "going out with a whimper"—terms that capture their fundamental differences in onset, progression, and manifestation. Other researchers refer to these as "decisive" versus "accumulative" pathways to failure ([Christiano, 2019](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/what-failure-looks-like); [Kasirzadeh, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07836)).

## Decisive Systemic Risks {#01}

**Decisive failures occur when system dynamics reach critical thresholds, triggering rapid collapse.** These failures happen when interconnected systems cross tipping points, causing cascading failures that propagate faster than humans can respond. The classic financial "flash crash" of 2010 exemplifies this pattern on a small scale: algorithmic traders reacted to each other's actions in a self-reinforcing spiral, causing a trillion-dollar market drop in minutes before human intervention restored stability. More catastrophic versions could unfold across multiple domains simultaneously ([Kirilenko et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.1249)).

**Decisive failures have clear triggering events that push systems past stability thresholds.** Unlike gradual deterioration, decisive failures have identifiable precipitating incidents—though the underlying vulnerability builds up beforehand. Multiple AI systems might interact in ways that suddenly destabilize critical infrastructure, financial markets, or information ecosystems, with effects amplifying across domains. This differs from misalignment scenarios because the catastrophe stems from interactions between systems rather than any single AI pursuing harmful goals ([Slattery et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12622)).

We have already talked about various self-reinforcing failures in the misuse section like flash war, and other cybersecurity related cascading incidents. In the main text, for sake of brevity we have chosen to only describe decisive systemic risks, and have moved the more concrete scenarios into the appendix since they have significant overlap with the kinds of failures we would see from misuse. Rather we choose to predominantly focus more on the second type of less discussed systemic risk - accumulative risks leading to gradual disempowerment.

<!-- Cascading Failures Section -->

## Accumulative Systemic Risks {#02}

### Epistemic Erosion {#02-01}

**Society's ability to distinguish fact from fiction deteriorates as AI-generated content floods our information ecosystem.** Unlike traditional information threats like censorship or propaganda that operate through clearly identifiable mechanisms, AI creates epistemic erosion through gradual degradation of knowledge formation, verification, and distribution systems. No single AI deployment fundamentally undermines shared knowledge, but their collective effect progressively destabilizes epistemic foundations. This risk grows proportionally with capabilities - as language models become more persuasive and generative capabilities more realistic, verification becomes exponentially harder. What fraction of new images indexed by Google, or Tweets, or comments on Reddit, or Youtube videos are generated by humans? Nobody knows – I don’t think it is a knowable number. And this less than two years into the advent of generative AI ([Aguirre, 2025](https://keepthefuturehuman.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Keep_the_Future_Human__AnthonyAguirre__5March2025.pdf)). The end state of this trajectory resembles synthetic information drowning out verifiable information ([Weidinger et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04359); [Kasirzadeh, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07836)).

**This erosion occurs both through intentional misuse and agent-agnostic systemic pressures.** While some actors deliberately deploy AI to pollute information environments for strategic advantage the more subtle risk comes from agent-agnostic systemic pressures.AI uniquely threatens epistemic stability through several cumulative mechanisms:

- **Volume overwhelming verification:** AI exponentially increases content generation capacity, overwhelming human verification systems through sheer volume. It can generate plausible content orders of magnitude faster than humans can reliably verify it.

- **Authenticity degradation:** AI progressively undermines verification through increasingly sophisticated impersonation capabilities.

- **Epistemic learned helplessness:** As distinguishing truth from falsehood becomes increasingly difficult, AI gradually induces widespread epistemic learned helplessness—a psychological state where people abandon truth-seeking because verification appears futile.

- **Authority displacement:** AI gradually displaces human epistemic authorities through ubiquitous availability and apparent expertise.

- **Personalized reality fragmentation:** AI recommendation systems increasingly curate not just content distribution but content creation itself, creating unprecedented personalization that fragments shared reality.

**Democratic governance, scientific progress, and market function all depend on shared epistemic foundations.** Epistemic erosion reduces our ability to collectively distinguish fact from fiction and assign appropriate confidence to claims. As these foundations erode, collective decision-making becomes increasingly dysfunctional without any single decisive failure. If trust in verification mechanisms declines, then epistemic safeguards themselves become less effective as general trust in information sources deteriorates—creating a compounding effect where verification becomes simultaneously more necessary yet less trusted.

**This erosion of our shared information environment might happen because of many small seemingly rational decisions.** News organizations facing budget pressures will likely adopt AI content generation to reduce costs. Platforms seeking to minimize harmful content will implement algorithmic filters that might inadvertently create selection pressure for information optimized to appear trustworthy rather than be trustworthy. Media production companies will likely invest in synthetic content that boost engagement, and viewers spend increasing amounts of their time watching AI-recommended videos of AI-generated content. Research institutions might choose to accelerate publication and writing using AI tools. Scientific papers contain increasing amounts of synthesized data and eventually potential fabricated citations forming circular reference loops. In this world, verified knowledge becomes practically impossible - not because verification technologies don't exist, but because for most humans the verification cost exceeds what markets will bear. This scenario isn't apocalyptic for any individual, but when multiplied across millions of people and thousands of decisions, it leads to gradual disempowerment and perhaps catastrophic risk due to the collapse of our collective ability to form accurate shared beliefs about reality. These decisions and thousands of similar ones make business sense in isolation, but collectively they may transform information ecosystems from ones where verification is possible to ones where distinguishing fact from fiction about the true state of the world becomes effectively impossible.

**Traditional verification systems will likely fail against sophisticated synthetic content.** Traditional verification mechanisms like fact-checking, peer review, and institutional credentialing all operate under capacity and speed constraints fundamentally mismatched to AI content generation capabilities. There are various methods being explored like digital content transparency, synthetic watermarking, data provenance ([Chandra et al., 2024](https://www.nist.gov/publications/reducing-risks-posed-synthetic-content-overview-technical-approaches-digital-content); [Longpre et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16787)), and blockchain based proofs of humanity ([Barros, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03752))/proofs of personhood ([WorldCoin, 2024](https://world.org/blog/world/proof-of-personhood-what-it-is-why-its-needed)). We talk about some of these in the chapter on strategies to mitigate risk. Public confidence in verification mechanisms shows concerning decline, with trust in fact-checking organizations decreasing over time. Most of the mitigation mechanisms and circuit breakers are not mature or widespread enough, and as is the theme of this entire section - individually applied technical mitigation strategies do not counter systemic pressures and incentives.

### Power Concentration {#02-02}

**We are already observing AI increasingly integrated into society.** AI might become so integrated and ubiquitous that societal participation might require interaction with AI systems, which in turn are locked behind APIs and controlled by a handful of corporations. Think about how gradually, the ability to participate in society has slowly moved towards needing to participate online or having access to things like a phone number or a smartphone. Such technologies become integrated into core societal functions like banking or healthcare. Private entities already determine credit access, job opportunities, and information flow through opaque algorithms. AI accelerates these natural “winner-take-all” dynamics where advantages compound rather than diminish over time.

**We are witnessing unprecedented power concentration through AI infrastructure that will be nearly impossible to reverse once established.** The computational requirements for frontier AI development have already created an oligopoly where just five companies control the foundation models that increasingly mediate human experiences. Unlike previous technologies, AI exhibits unique compounding advantages that systematically eliminate competition over time.

**Power can concentrate into different entities: corporate or state, each with distinct patterns but similar outcomes: diminished individual agency and concentrated control.** Only a handful of companies like Microsoft/OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind can afford to train frontier foundation models due to the enormous data acquisition costs or hardware computational requirements. These powerful models then serve as the base for countless applications, creating upstream control that ripples throughout the economy. Only a few states in 2025 like the USA and China have companies that can train foundation models of this scale. They have greater access to these technologies, and in the extreme scenarios of global competition and AI races might even choose to nationalize them ([Aschenbrenner, 2024](https://situational-awareness.ai/)). In either case the point remains the same, power can concentrate into a small number of entities - these can be state or private. Here is a briefly list of the centralizing forces that we currently have at play for each of the three:

-**Corporate concentration leverages data and compute advantages that are uniquely self-reinforcing with AI.** The cloud computing market has consolidated around a few providers who control the infrastructure necessary for AI development. Similarly, foundation model development has centralized among a handful of companies with sufficient resources. These companies benefit from powerful feedback loops: more data leads to better models, which attract more users, generating still more data.

- **State concentration advances through AI-powered surveillance and automated governance.** A social credit system is an example of how comprehensive data integration could enable unprecedented state control over citizen behavior. This pattern extends beyond authoritarian states—democratic governments have significantly increased investment in AI surveillance technologies. Administrative automation removes human discretion from governance, with algorithmic systems processing vast numbers of regulatory decisions and enforcement actions without meaningful oversight. These systems operate with increasing autonomy, gradually displacing traditional governance mechanisms. ([Feldstein, 2021](https://carnegie-production-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/files/WP-Feldstein-AISurveillance_final1.pdf))

<Note title="Eroding digital privacy further enables power concentration" collapsed={true}>

The loss of individual privacy is among the factors that might accelerate power concentration. Better persuasion and predictive models of human behavior benefit from gathering more data about individual users. The desire for profit or to predict the flow of a country's resources, demographics, culture, etc. might incentivize behavior like intercepting personal data or legally eavesdropping on people’s activities. Data Mining can be used to collect and analyze large amounts of data from various sources such as social media, purchases, and internet usage. This information can be pieced together to create a complete picture of an individual's behavior, preferences, and lifestyle (Russel, 2019). Voice Recognition technologies can be used to recognize speech, which could potentially lead to widespread wiretapping. For example, a system like the U.S. government's Echelon system uses language translation, speech recognition, and keyword searching to automatically sift through telephone, email, fax, and telex traffic (Russel & Norvig, 1994). AI can also be used to identify individuals in public spaces using facial recognition. This capability can potentially invade a person's privacy if a random stranger can easily identify them in public places.

Whenever AI systems are used to collect and analyze data on a mass scale regimes can further strengthen self-reinforcing control. Personal information can be used to unfairly or unethically influence people's behavior. This can occur from both a state and a corporate perspective.

</Note>

**When power structures become permanently entrenched, human moral progress stops.** Consider historical moral improvements like the abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, or environmental protection—each required shifting existing power structures through social movements, democratic processes, or occasionally revolution. AI-enabled power concentration threatens to create systems resistant to all these change mechanisms. Imagine if historical power structures had access to perfect surveillance, influence operations, and automated enforcement—many moral advances might never have occurred. Power concentration enables existential risks like value lock in, or value erosion which we talk about in individual sections below.

### Value lock-in {#02-03}

**Polluting the information ecosystem.** The deliberate propagation of disinformation is already a serious issue reducing our shared understanding of reality and polarizing opinions. AIs could be used to severely exacerbate this problem by generating personalized disinformation on a larger scale than ever before. Additionally, as AIs become better at predicting and nudging our behavior, they will become more capable of manipulating us. We will now discuss how AIs could be leveraged by malicious actors to create a fractured and dysfunctional society.

First, AIs could be used to generate unique personalized disinformation at a large scale. While there are already many social media bots, some of which exist to spread disinformation, historically they have been run by humans or primitive text generators. The latest AI systems do not need humans to generate personalized messages, never get tired, and can potentially interact with millions of users at once ([Hendrycks, 2024](https://www.aisafetybook.com/textbook/malicious-use)).

As things like deep fakes become ever more practical (e.g., with fake kidnapping scams) ([Karimi, 2023](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/29/us/ai-scam-calls-kidnapping-cec/index.html)). AI-powered tools could be used to generate and disseminate false or misleading information at scale, potentially influencing elections or undermining public trust in institutions.

**AIs can exploit users’ trust.** Already, hundreds of thousands of people pay for chatbots marketed as lovers and friends ([Tong, 2023](https://www.reuters.com/technology/what-happens-when-your-ai-chatbot-stops-loving-you-back-2023-03-18/)), and one man’s suicide has been partially attributed to interactions with a chatbot ([Xiang, 2023](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkadgm/man-dies-by-suicide-after-talking-with-ai-chatbot-widow-says)). As AIs appear increasingly human-like, people will increasingly form relationships with them and grow to trust them. AIs that gather personal information through relationship-building or by accessing extensive personal data, such as a user’s email account or personal files, could leverage that information to enhance persuasion. Powerful actors that control those systems could exploit user trust by delivering personalized disinformation directly through people’s “friends.”

If AIs become too deeply embedded into society and are highly persuasive, we might see a scenario where a system's current values, principles, or procedures become so deeply entrenched that they are resistant to change. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as technological constraints, economic costs, or social and institutional inertia. The danger with value lock-in is the potential for perpetuating harmful or outdated values, especially when these values are institutionalized in influential systems like AI.

Locking in certain values may curtail humanity’s moral progress. It’s dangerous to allow any set of values to become permanently entrenched in society. For example, AI systems have learned racist and sexist views ([Hendrycks, 2024](https://www.aisafetybook.com/textbook/malicious-use)), and once those views are learned, it can be difficult to fully remove them. In addition to problems we know exist in our society, there may be some we still do not. Just as we abhor some moral views widely held in the past, people in the future may want to move past moral views that we hold today, even those we currently see no problem with. For example, moral defects in AI systems would be even worse if AI systems had been trained in the 1960s, and many people at the time would have seen no problem with that. Therefore, when advanced AIs emerge and transform the world, there is a risk of their objectives locking in or perpetuating defects in today’s values. If AIs are not designed to continuously learn and update their understanding of societal values, they may perpetuate or reinforce existing defects in their decision-making processes long into the future.

In a world with widespread persuasive AI systems, people’s beliefs might be almost entirely determined by which AI systems they interact with most. Never knowing whom to trust, people could retreat even further into ideological enclaves, fearing that any information from outside those enclaves might be a sophisticated lie. This would erode consensus reality, people’s ability to cooperate with others, participate in civil society, and address collective action problems. This would also reduce our ability to have a conversation as a species about how to mitigate existential risks from AIs.

In summary, AIs could create highly effective, personalized disinformation on an unprecedented scale, and could be particularly persuasive to people they have built personal relationships with. In the hands of many people, this could create a deluge of disinformation that debilitates human society.

**Economic Upheaval.** The automation of the economy could lead to widespread impacts on the labor market, potentially exacerbating economic inequalities and social divisions ([Dai, 2019](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Sn5NiiD5WBi4dLzaB/agi-will-drastically-increase-economies-of-scale-1)). This shift towards mass unemployment could also contribute to mental health issues by making human labor increasingly redundant ([Federspiel et al., 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37160371/)).

**Disempowerment & Enfeeblement.** AI systems could make individual choices and agency less relevant as decisions are increasingly made or influenced by automated processes. This occurs when humans delegate increasingly important tasks to machines, leading to a loss of self-governance and complete dependence on machines. This scenario is reminiscent of the film Wall-E in which humans become dependent on machines ([Hendrycks et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12001)).

<Note title="Systemic risk story - The production web." collapsed={true}>

**The economic incentives to automate are strong** and may lead to certain risks. A system with a human in the loop is slower than a fully automated system.

**The production web.** A consequence of AI that could create risks at a societal scale is described in the paper “[TASRA: a Taxonomy and Analysis of Societal-Scale Risks from AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06924),” in the form of a short story: '*Story 1b: The Production Web,*' which depicts a kind of capitalism on steroids, which gradually depletes all the natural resources necessary for human survival.

<Iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-industrial-robots-installed?tab=chart" width="100%" height="600px" loading="lazy" allow="web-share; clipboard-write" frameBorder="0" number="4" label="2.4" caption="Number of industrial robots in use grows every year ([Giattino et al., 2023](https://ourworldindata.org/artificial-intelligence))." />

The story goes roughly like so - In a world where the economy is increasingly automated by AI systems that are much faster than humans, there arises a competitive pressure such that only the fastest companies survive. In this context, businesses with humans in the loop would be less efficient compared to those fully automated. Consequently, we would gradually see a world where humans are replaced and cede control to machines because their quality of life improves by doing so. And progressively, control is progressively handed over to more competitive machines. However, the economic system designed by these machines does not fully account for negative externalities. It maximizes metrics that are mere proxies for the actual well-being of humans. As a result, we get a system that rapidly consumes vast amounts of raw materials essential for human survival, such as air, rare metals, and oxygen, because machines do not need the same types of resources as humans. This could gradually lead us to a world uninhabitable by humans. It would no longer be possible to disconnect this system because humans would become dependent on it, just as today it is not possible to disconnect the Internet because the entire logistics and supply chain depends on it.

**Note that the previous story does not require AI agents.** This is a Robust Agent-Agnostic Process (RAAPs), meaning that this story can occur with or without agentic AIs. Nonetheless, the authors of this chapter think that an AI Agent could make this story more plausible. In the article “[Why Tool AIs Want to Be Agent AIs](https://gwern.net/tool-ai),” the author explains: “AIs limited to pure computation (Tool AIs) supporting humans, will be less intelligent, efficient, and economically valuable than more autonomous reinforcement-learning AIs (Agent AIs) who act on their own and meta-learn because all problems are reinforcement-learning problems. […] All of these actions will result in Agent AIs being more intelligent than Tool AIs, in addition to their greater economic competitiveness. […]”.
